Problem Statement –A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The
chocolate packets here represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find
the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
Example 1 :
N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty
packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
Input :
8 – Value of N
[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] – Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by
newline
Output:
4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0


Ans)ublic class Main{
    public static void swap(int a[],int i,int j)
    {
        int temp=a[i];
        a[i]=a[j];
        a[j]=temp;
    }
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        int a[]={4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0};
        int b=1;
        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
           for(int j=i+1;j<a.length;j++)
           {
            if(a[i]==0)
            {
                swap(a, i,j);
            }
           }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            System.out.print(a[i]+" ");
        }
    }
}

Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is
greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of 3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:
Input
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]
9-> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
3
Example 2:
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3 -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
5
